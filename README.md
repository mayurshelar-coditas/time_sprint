Assignment 4: Playing with widgets and state


Create a Stopwatch application in Flutter, which provides functionality to users to start, pause and reset.

Use a combination of stateful, stateless widgets along with flutter basics to complete the assignment.

Must have:
Timer in centre, hh:mm:ss format surrounded by circle for showing second progress.
Two buttons below it to start, pause and reset.
